"""
This module contains a basic implementation of an efficient, in-memory 3-way
git tree merge. This is used rather than traditional git mechanisms to avoid
needing to use the index file format, which can be slow to initialize for
large repositories.

The INDEX file for my local mozilla-central checkout, for reference, is 35MB.
While this isn't huge, it takes a perceptable amount of time to read the tree
files and generate. This algorithm, on the other hand, avoids looking at
unmodified trees and blobs when possible.
