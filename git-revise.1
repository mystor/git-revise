.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fIgit revise\fP [<options>] [<target>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgit revise\fP is a \fBgit(1)\fP subcommand to efficiently
update, split, and rearrange commits. It is heavily inspired by
\fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP, however tries to be more efficient and ergonomic for
patch\-stack oriented workflows.
.sp
By default, \fBgit revise\fP will apply staged changes to <target>,
updating \fBHEAD\fP to point at the revised history. It also supports splitting
commits, rewording commit messages.
.sp
Unlike \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP, \fBgit revise\fP avoids modifying
working directory and index state, performing all merges in\-memory, and only
writing them when necessary. This allows it to be significantly faster on
large codebases, and avoid invalidating builds.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-autosquash\fP or \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP is specified, the
<target> argument is optional. If it is omitted, \fBgit revise\fP will
consider a range of unpublished commits on the current branch.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Stage changes to tracked files before revising.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-index
Ignore staged changes in the index.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-reauthor
Reset target commit\(aqs author to the current user.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ref <gitref>
Working branch to update; defaults to \fBHEAD\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Main modes of operation
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-interactive
Rather than applying staged changes to <target>, edit a todo list of
actions to perform on commits after <target>. See \fI\%INTERACTIVE MODE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-autosquash
Rather than directly applying staged changes to <target>, automatically
perform fixup or squash actions marked with \fBfixup!\fP or \fBsquash!\fP
between <target> and the current \fBHEAD\fP\&. For more information on what
these actions do, see \fI\%INTERACTIVE MODE\fP\&.
.sp
These commits are usually created with \fBgit commit \-\-fixup=<commit>\fP or
\fBgit commit \-\-squash=<commit>\fP, and identify the target with the first
line of its commit message.
.sp
This option can be combined with \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP to modify the
generated todos before they\(aqre executed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cut
Interactively select hunks from <target>. The chosen hunks are split into
a second commit immediately after the target.
.sp
After splitting is complete, both commit\(aqs messages are edited.
.sp
See the "Interactive Mode" section of \fBgit\-add(1)\fP to learn how
to operate this mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-edit
After applying staged changes, edit <target>\(aqs commit message.
.sp
This option can be combined with \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP to allow editing
of commit messages within the todo list. For more information on, see
\fI\%INTERACTIVE MODE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m <msg>, \-\-message <msg>
Use the given <msg> as the new commit message for <target>. If multiple
\fI\%\-m\fP options are given, their values are concatenated as separate
paragraphs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFLICT RESOLUTION
.sp
When a conflict is encountered, \fBgit revise\fP will attempt to resolve
it automatically using standard git mechanisms. If automatic resolution
fails, the user will be prompted to resolve them manually.
.sp
There is currently no support for using \fBgit\-mergetool(1)\fP to
resolve conflicts.
.sp
No attempt is made to detect renames of files or directories. \fBgit
revise\fP may produce suboptimal results across renames. Use the interactive
mode of \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP when rename tracking is important.
.SH NOTES
.sp
A successful \fBgit revise\fP will add a single entry to the reflog,
allowing it to be undone with \fBgit reset @{1}\fP\&. Unsuccessful \fBgit
revise\fP commands will leave your repository largely unmodified.
.sp
No marge commits may occur between the target commit and \fBHEAD\fP, as
rewriting them is not supported.
.sp
See \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP for more information on the implications of
modifying history on a repository that you share.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.sp
\fBgit revise\fP supports an interactive mode inspired by the
interactive mode of \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP\&.
.sp
This mode is started with the last commit you want to retain "as\-is":
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git revise \-i <after\-this\-commit>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
An editor will be fired up with the commits in your current branch after the
given commit. If the index has any staged but uncommitted changes, a \fB<git
index>\fP entry will also be present.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pick 8338dfa88912 Oneline summary of first commit
pick 735609912343 Summary of second commit
index 672841329981 <git index>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These commits may be re\-ordered to change the order they appear in history.
In addition, the \fBpick\fP and \fBindex\fP commands may be replaced to modify
their behaviour.
.sp
If \fI\%\-e\fP was specified, the full commit message will be included, and
each command line will begin with a \fB++\fP\&. Any changes made to the commit
messages in this file will be applied to the commit in question, allowing for
simultaneous editing of commit messages during the todo editing phase.
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
The following commands are supported in all interactive modes:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B index
Do not commit these changes, instead leaving them staged in the index.
Index lines must come last in the file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pick
Use the given commit as\-is in history. When applied to the generated
\fBindex\fP entry, the commit will have the message \fB<git index>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B fixup
Add the commit\(aqs changes into the previous commit, discarding it\(aqs commit
message.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B squash
Like fuse, but also open an editor to merge the commit\(aqs messages.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B reword
Open an eitor to modify the commit message.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cut
Interactively select hunks from the commit. The chosen hunks are split
