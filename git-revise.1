.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fIgit revise\fP [<options>] [<target>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgit revise\fP is a \fBgit(1)\fP subcommand to efficiently
update, split, and rearrange commits. It is heavily inspired by
\fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP, however tries to be more efficient and ergonomic for
patch\-stack oriented workflows.
.sp
By default, \fBgit revise\fP will apply staged changes to <target>,
updating \fBHEAD\fP to point at the revised history. It also supports splitting
commits, rewording commit messages.
.sp
Unlike \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP, \fBgit revise\fP avoids modifying
working directory and index state, performing all merges in\-memory, and only
writing them when necessary. This allows it to be significantly faster on
large codebases, and avoid invalidating builds.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-autosquash\fP or \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP is specified, the
<target> argument is optional. If it is omitted, \fBgit revise\fP will
consider a range of unpublished commits on the current branch.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Stage changes to tracked files before revising.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-patch
Interactively stage hunks from the worktree before revising.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-index
Ignore staged changes in the index.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-reauthor
Reset target commit\(aqs author to the current user.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ref <gitref>
Working branch to update; defaults to \fBHEAD\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Main modes of operation
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-interactive
Rather than applying staged changes to <target>, edit a todo list of
actions to perform on commits after <target>. See \fI\%INTERACTIVE MODE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-autosquash, \-\-no\-autosquash
Rather than directly applying staged changes to <target>, automatically
perform fixup or squash actions marked with \fBfixup!\fP or \fBsquash!\fP
between <target> and the current \fBHEAD\fP\&. For more information on what
these actions do, see \fI\%INTERACTIVE MODE\fP\&.
.sp
These commits are usually created with \fBgit commit \-\-fixup=<commit>\fP or
\fBgit commit \-\-squash=<commit>\fP, and identify the target with the first
line of its commit message.
.sp
This option can be combined with \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP to modify the
generated todos before they\(aqre executed.
.sp
If the \fI\%\-\-autosquash\fP option is enabled by default using a
configuration variable, the option \fI\%\-\-no\-autosquash\fP can be used
to override and disable this setting. See \fI\%CONFIGURATION\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cut
Interactively select hunks from <target>. The chosen hunks are split into
a second commit immediately after the target.
.sp
After splitting is complete, both commits\(aq messages are edited.
.sp
See the "Interactive Mode" section of \fBgit\-add(1)\fP to learn how
to operate this mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-edit
After applying staged changes, edit <target>\(aqs commit message.
.sp
This option can be combined with \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP to allow editing
of commit messages within the todo list. For more information on, see
\fI\%INTERACTIVE MODE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m <msg>, \-\-message <msg>
Use the given <msg> as the new commit message for <target>. If multiple
\fI\%\-m\fP options are given, their values are concatenated as separate
paragraphs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
Configuration is managed by \fBgit\-config(1)\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B revise.autoSquash
If set to true, imply \fI\%\-\-autosquash\fP whenever \fI\%\-\-interactive\fP
is specified. Overridden by \fI\%\-\-no\-autosquash\fP\&. Defaults to false. If
not set, the value of \fBrebase.autoSquash\fP is used instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B revise.run\-hooks.commit\-msg
If set to true the \fBcommit\-msg\fP hook will be run after exiting the
editor. Defaults to false, because (unlike with \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP)
the worktree state might not reflect the commit state. If the hook takes
the worktree state into account, it might behave differently.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFLICT RESOLUTION
.sp
When a conflict is encountered, \fBgit revise\fP will attempt to resolve
it automatically using standard git mechanisms. If automatic resolution
fails, the user will be prompted to resolve them manually.
.sp
There is currently no support for using \fBgit\-mergetool(1)\fP to
resolve conflicts.
.sp
No attempt is made to detect renames of files or directories. \fBgit
revise\fP may produce suboptimal results across renames. Use the interactive
mode of \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP when rename tracking is important.
.SH NOTES
.sp
A successful \fBgit revise\fP will add a single entry to the reflog,
allowing it to be undone with \fBgit reset @{1}\fP\&. Unsuccessful \fBgit
revise\fP commands will leave your repository largely unmodified.
.sp
No merge commits may occur between the target commit and \fBHEAD\fP, as
rewriting them is not supported.
.sp
See \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP for more information on the implications of
modifying history on a repository that you share.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.sp
\fBgit revise\fP supports an interactive mode inspired by the
interactive mode of \fBgit\-rebase(1)\fP\&.
.sp
This mode is started with the last commit you want to retain "as\-is":
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git revise \-i <after\-this\-commit>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
An editor will be fired up with the commits in your current branch after the
given commit. If the index has any staged but uncommitted changes, a \fB<git
index>\fP entry will also be present.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pick 8338dfa88912 Oneline summary of first commit
pick 735609912343 Summary of second commit
index 672841329981 <git index>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These commits may be re\-ordered to change the order they appear in history.
In addition, the \fBpick\fP and \fBindex\fP commands may be replaced to modify
their behaviour. If present, \fBindex\fP commands must be at the bottom of the
list, i.e. they can not be followed by non\-index commands.
.sp
If \fI\%\-e\fP was specified, the full commit message will be included, and
each command line will begin with a \fB++\fP\&. Any changes made to the commit
messages in this file will be applied to the commit in question, allowing for
simultaneous editing of commit messages during the todo editing phase.
