`git revise` is a `git` subcommand to efficiently update, split, and rearrange
commits. It is heavily inspired by `git rebase`, however it tries to be more
efficient and ergonomic for patch-stack oriented workflows.

By default, `git revise` will apply staged changes to a target commit, then
update `HEAD` to point at the revised history. It also supports splitting
commits and rewording commit messages.

Unlike `git rebase`, `git revise` avoids modifying the working directory or
the index state, performing all merges in-memory and only writing them when
necessary. This allows it to be significantly faster on large codebases and
avoids unnecessarily invalidating builds.
